## Requisites

```
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation

## Foundry

### Tests

To run tests:

```
forge test
```

- `-vv` shows console.log output.
- `-vvvvv` shows execution and setup traces for all tests.

To run specific tests:

- `--mt` runs tests matching the specified regex.

Example:

```
forge test --mt test_Depositor -vv
```

### Cheatsheet

## Security

### Challenges

Challenges can be found in the [/test](./test) folder.

Your goal is to make all tests PASS âœ¨

You'll find the tags `START OF SOLUTION` and `END OF SOLUTION` on each test file. You should write your solution there.

You may create and instantiate new contracts to help you with the solution, as long as the `new Contract()` is instantiated and called between those tags.

Cheatcodes are not allowed of course :)

**Solutions can be found in the `solutions` branch`**

```
git checkout -b solutions
forge test
```
